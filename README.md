# Lecture 25: Interaction in Babylon/WebXR

Detailed explanation of this code can be found in the lecture video (will be added after class).

## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

The instructor is using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  However, you can use any code or text editor.

## Running 

You set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from npm with 
```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:
```
npm run start
```

For those familiar with Typescript, you do not have to run ```tsc``` to build the .js files from the .ts files;  ```npx``` builds them on the fly as part of running webpack.

You can run the sample by pointing your web browser at ```http://localhost:8080```.  Note that you may need to use your local IP address instead of ``localhost``.
